# hello-world
This repository is my first one on GitHub.  

Hello World!  I have 13 years of beginning-to-end software development life cycle (SDLC) experience, comprising 6 enterprise applications and 1 commerical software application.  But then, I took more than a decade off to raise my sweet and beautiful daughter.  

So, yes, I'm learning GitHub.  I was accepted into FSCJ's I-TECH Rapid Reemployment program where I am learning Java, jGRASP and SFC.  In addition, I'm learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript using Codecademy and Skillport.
