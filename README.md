# hello-world
This repository is my first one on GitHub.  

Hello World!  Yes, I'm starting my career over, after taking more than a decade off to raise my sweet and beautiful daughter.  So, yes, I'm learning GitHub :-)  I am enrolled in FSCJ's I-TECH Rapid Reemployment program where I am learning Java.  In addition, I'm learning HTML, CSS, & JavaScript using Codecademy and Skillport.
