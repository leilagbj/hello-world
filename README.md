# hello-world
This repository is my first one on GitHub.  

Hello World!  I have 13 years of beginning-to-end software development life cycle (SDLC) experience, comprising 6 enterprise applications and 1 commerical software application.  But then, I took more than a decade off to raise my sweet and beautiful daughter.  I know, I know...things have changed since then. So, yes, I'm learning GitHub.  

I was accepted into FSCJ's I-TECH Rapid Reemployment program where I am learning Java, jGRASP, NetBeans, and SFC.  In addition, I'm learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript using Codecademy and Skillport.

It is great to be back developing software again.  So, here's to learning!
